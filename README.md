## ðŸ§© How to Add a New Card (Resource)

When you want to add a **new card** to the main page, follow these steps:

### 1. Add content (markdown)
Create a new `.md` file for the content of your card inside:

```bash
docs/List/
```
If your markdown content includes images, put them inside:

```bash
docs/List/images/
```
### 2. Add card info to homepage
Go to:

```bash
src/data/
```
Add your new card entry to the appropriate .mdx file.

### 3. Add the card logo

Place your logo inside:

```bash
static/img/card_logo/
```

## Development

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Using SSH:

```
$ USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
